I am a young scientist and enthusiast advocate of open science and effective altruism. Using the tools of experimental psychology, statistics and neuroscience, and most recently social computational science, I investigate research questions concerning social interaction and mental health. My current projects as a postdoc at the Computational Social Science Group Vienna, focus on collective emotions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic using social media analysis, characteristics of media reports about suicide that could contribute to prevention. During my PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience and Master's in Psychology, I did research in the areas of face perception, emotional expression, social power, embodiment, intergroup behavior, gender, “social” hormones, and stress.
