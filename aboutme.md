title: About me
---

I am a young scientist and enthusiast advocate of open science and effective altruism. Using the tools of experimental psychology, and neuroscience and social computational science, I investigate research questions concerning social interaction and mental health. As a postdoc at the Computational Social Science Group Vienna, I currently work on the following projects: 

* Collective emotions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic using social media analysis, and
* Characteristics of media reports about suicide that could contribute to prevention 
* Emotional Misinformation: how does emotional arousal influence the spreading of misinformation?

During my PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience and Master's in Psychology, I did research in the areas of face perception, emotional experssions, social power, embodiment, intergroup behavior, gender, “social” hormones, and stress.
