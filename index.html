<p>I am a postdoctoral scientist with a background in psychology and social and affective neuroscience, and currently a member of the Computational Social Science lab at the Complexity Science Hub Vienna. My research focuses on social media as a tool to better understand social behavior and mental health. I use social media as a data source, study their effects, and investigate social behavior in digital environments.

<br>  <br>

In my current research, I apply methods like text analysis and machine learning to capture digital traces of emotions, to investigate their validity, as well as their effects on misinformation spreading on social media. I further explore potential contributions of news and social media content to suicide prevention. I am part of the Open Science and the Effective Altruism community and strive to increase the transparency, reproducibility, and social impact of my work.

<br>  <br>

My research in neuroscience was inspired by the complex relationship between social and emotional experiences and the body, including hormonal changes and brain activity. I investigated how we perceive others facial expressions, how we react to their non-verbal social signals, and how our own bodily state and and social power influence these social interactions.
