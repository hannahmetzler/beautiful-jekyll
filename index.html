<p>I am a young scientist with a background in psychology and social and affective neuroscience, as well as an enthusiast advocate of open science and effective altruism. My research interests lie in the areas of social cognition, interaction and mental health. My early research was inspired by the complex relationship between social and emotional experiences and the body, including hormonal changes and brain activity. I investigated social perception (emotions, gaze, trustworthiness and dominance), social decision-making, embodiment of social power, and gender differences in the response to stress. In my current research, I focus on emotions and social behavior  at the collective level, as well as the influence of online and media communication on mental health.</p>
