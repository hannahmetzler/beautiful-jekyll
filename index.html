<p>I am a young scientist and enthusiast advocate of open science and effective altruism. Using the tools of experimental psychology, cognitive neuroscience and social computational science, I investigate research questions concerning social interaction and mental health. As a postdoc at the Computational Social Science Group Vienna, I currently work on the following projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collective emotions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic using social media analysis</li>
<li>Characteristics of media reports about suicide that could contribute to prevention</li>
<li>Emotional Misinformation: how do emotions influence the spreading of misinformation?</li>
</ul>
<p>During my PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience and Master’s in Psychology, I did research in the areas of face perception, emotional experssions, social power, embodiment, intergroup behavior, gender, “social” hormones, and stress.</p>
