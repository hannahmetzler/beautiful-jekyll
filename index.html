<p>I am a postdoctoral scientist with a background in psychology and social and affective neuroscience, and currently a member of the Computational Social Science lab at the Complexity Science Hub Vienna. My research aims at understanding how emotions and social processes influence communication in interpersonal as well as digital environments.  <br>  <br>

My early research was inspired by the complex relationship between social and emotional experiences and the body, including hormonal changes and brain activity. I investigated how we perceive others facial expressions, how we react to their non-verbal social signals, and how our own bodily state and and social power influence these social interactions. <br>  <br>


In my current research, I apply methods like text analysis and machine learning to capture emotions at the collective level, and investigate their effects on misinformation spreading on social media. I further explore potential contributions of news and social media content to suicide prevention. I am part of the Open Science and the Effective Altruism community and strive to increase the transparency, reproducibility, and social impact of my work.
