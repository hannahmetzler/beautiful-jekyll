<p>I am a young scientist with a background in psychology and social and affective neuroscience, and an enthusiast advocate of open science and effective altruism. I currently work as a postdoc in computational social science at the Complexity Science Hub Vienna. Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in the areas of social interaction and mental health. My early research was inspired by the complex relationship between social and emotional experiences and the body, including hormonal changes and brain activity. I investigated social perception (emotions, gaze, trustworthiness and dominance), social decision-making, embodiment of social power, and gender differences in stress responses. In my current research in computational social science, I focus on emotions and social behavior  at the collective level, as well as the influence of online and media communication on mental health. </p>
