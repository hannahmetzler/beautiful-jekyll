Check out our [social media dashboard](http://www.mpellert.at/covid19_monitor_austria/#twitter-emotions-in-austria) of emotions, social and prosocial attitudes during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria.

If you are interested in how we created the dashboard, check out this [Preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11158).

A scientific analysis and interpretation of changes of collective emotions on Twitter during the pandemic outbreak is described in this[paper](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/qejxv), published in the journal [Emotion](https://doi.org/10.1037/emo0001111).
