### Social Cognitive Science

During my PhD, I explored how body postures expressing social power influence face perception and social interaction. I applied experimental techniques from cognitive science, statistical models and image analyses methods, and analyzed eye and mouse tracking data as well as salivary hormone levels. The "replication crisis" in psychology sparked an intense discussion about the research my project was built on. Really caring about the quality of my own contributions to science, I therefore made my own research as rigorous and reproducible as possible, and became involved in the [open science community](http://improvingpsych.org/).

### Social and Affective Neuroscience

#### Lab rotations during the ENP Graduate Program

During the first year of the ENP Graduate Program, I explored various topics and techniques in the area of Social and Affective Neuroscience with researchers from the ENP network. With Franck Ramus at École Normale Supérieure, I investigated anatomical brain differences associated with the fraternal-birth-order-effect related to male homosexuality, and prepared seminars about the broader topic of "sexual cognition" and human sexuality. I then worked in the group of Nathalie George at the Brain and Spine Institute, analyzing intracranial EEG data to examine the integration of gaze and emotional expression cues in the superior temporal sulcus, one of the core structures of the „social brain“. Finally, I started investigating the effect of power-related body postures on the relevance of emotional expressions for the perceiver in the team of Julie Grèzes. I used a model-based approach to analyze how adopting expansive and contracted postures affects the recognition of facial emotions, depending on additional social cues such as gaze direction.
 

#### Master Project

For my Master thesis, I worked in a large research project exploring the role of sex differences and the menstrual cycle in the response to different types of stressors. We compared the effects of social and achievement stress on subjective emotional responses, the social hormones testosterone and progesterone, and on neural activity measured with fMRI. My diploma thesis focused on [Sex differences in neural and hormonal responses to achievement stress](http://othes.univie.ac.at/27600/).

### Open Science

As a project manager for the EU-funded project [ON-MERRIT](https://on-merrit.eu/), I coordinated the activities of several research institutions, and investigated how the open science movement could be shaped so that the scientific system actually become more equitable and participatory.
